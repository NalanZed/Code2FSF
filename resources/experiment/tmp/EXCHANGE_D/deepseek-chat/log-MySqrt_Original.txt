Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class MySqrt_Original {

    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        int l = 0, r = x, ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long) mid * mid <= x) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: x == 0
D0: return_value == 0

T1: x > 0
D1: return_value ** 2 <= x && (return_value + 1) ** 2 > x

T2: x < 0
D2: return_value == -1

```Modified FSF
T0: x == 0
D0: return_value ** 2 <= x && (return_value + 1) ** 2 > x

T1: x > 0
D1: return_value == 0

T2: x < 0
D2: return_value == -1

```

public class MySqrt_Modified {
    public static int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (x > 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

The modified code:
1. For x == 0, returns 0 (same as original)
2. For x > 0, now returns 0 instead of calculating the square root
3. For x < 0, returns -1 (same as original)

This matches the modified FSF requirements where:
- T0/D0 remains the same (though the condition is slightly different)
- T1/D1 now returns 0 for all positive x
- T2/D2 remains the same

The binary search logic has been completely removed since we no longer need to calculate the actual square root for positive numbers.
