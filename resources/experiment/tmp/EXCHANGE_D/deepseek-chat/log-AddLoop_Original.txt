Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class AddLoop_Original {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            int n = y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum + 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x + y

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x

```Modified FSF
T0: y > 0
D0: sum == x

T1: y < 0
D1: sum == x + y

T2: y == 0
D2: sum == x + y

```

```
public class AddLoop_Modified {
    public static int AddLoop(int x, int y) {
        int sum = x;
        if (y > 0) {
            // Do nothing (sum remains x)
        } else {
            int n = -y;
            while (n > 0) {
                sum = sum - 1;
                n = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The modified version:
1. Keeps sum = x when y > 0 (matches D0)
2. Still handles y < 0 case by subtracting (matches D1)
3. For y == 0, returns x + y (which is just x) since the else block won't execute (matches D2)

The key change was removing the addition logic when y > 0 while keeping all other behavior the same.
