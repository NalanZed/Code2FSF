Please modify the following code according to the modified FSF:
```Code


public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}

```
```Original FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```Modified FSF
T0: satellites < 4 && signalStrength < 20
D0: alarm == 2

T1: satellites < 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D1: alarm == 1

T2: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength < 20
D2: alarm == 2

T3: satellites >= 4 && signalStrength >= 20
D3: alarm == 0

```

The modified FSF is actually identical to the original FSF in this case. Since there are no changes between the original and modified FSF specifications, the code doesn't need any modifications. The original code already correctly implements the specified behavior.

Here's the original code (which remains correct for the given FSF):

```
public class GPSCheck_Original {
    public static int GPSCheck(int satellites, int signalStrength) {
        int alarm = 0;
        if (satellites < 4) {
            alarm = 1;
        }
        if (signalStrength < 20) {
            alarm = 2;
        }
        return alarm;
    }
}
```

The code already satisfies all the conditions:
- When both conditions are bad (satellites < 4 and signalStrength < 20), alarm = 2 (priority to signal strength)
- When only satellites are insufficient, alarm = 1
- When only signal is weak, alarm = 2
- When both are good, alarm = 0

No modifications are needed as the original code already perfectly matches the modified FSF.
